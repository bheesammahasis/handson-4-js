    QUESTION NO9:-Unique Color Shirt
    Prepbuddy is very tasteful of clothes. 
    He has N numbers of shirts hanging in the hanger in his wardrobe.
    Prepbuddy likes to wear different colored clothes. So, whenever he see there 
    are two or more shirts with the same color, he removes all the shirt of 
    that color from his wardrobe. Now, he wants to know how many M unique color 
    shirts 
    are left in the wardrobe. 
    Prepbuddy wants you to find M.
    Note: As there are many shades of a color so consider integers as a color 
    name.
    i.e, color of shirt is 0,1,2, … , N.
    Input Format
    The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of 
    shirts in the wardrobe.
    The second line of the input contains N integers C1,C2,C3,C4,...,CN color of 
    shirts (separated by space).
    Output Format
    Return a single integer M denoting the unique colored shirts left in the 
    wardrobe.

    Input: C=3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3
    Output: 2
    There are two 2-color shirts, and two 3-color shirts.
    So, after removing 2-color and 3-color shirts, the remaining shirts are one 
    4-color shirt and one 1-color shirt i.e, 4, 1.
    Hence, the output will be 2.

    QUESTION NO10:-Min and Max
    Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly 
    simple array problem to solve. If you know how to iterate through the array, 
    you will easily be able to solve this.The problem statement is simple- given 
     N elements, find the minimum and maximum numbers among those elements.
    Input format
    First-line contains 
    N representing the length of the array.The second line contains N space- 
    separated integers.
    Output format
    Return minimum and maximum elements.
    Constraints
    1<=N<10^7
    0<= A[i]<= 10^7

    QUESTION NO11:-Birthday Game
    Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much 
    and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares 
    consists of an integer represented by A[i]. 
    She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such 
    that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month M and the sum 
    of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday D. You must 
     determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

    The first line consists of an integer N which denotes the number of squares 
      in the chocolate bar.       
    The second line consists of N space-separated integers A[i], consisting of 
      numbers on the chocolate bar squares.        
    The third line contains an integer D and M which denotes Yatharth's birthday 
      and his birth month respectively.     
    Output Format
    Print an integer denoting the total number of ways that Anamika can 
    partition her chocolate bar to share with Yatharth.
